# **🌙🚀 SOLSTICE DEPLOY RITUALS 🚀🌙**  
*(Because pushing to prod isn't scary enough)*  

---

## **⚡ OFFICIAL PRE-DEPLOY CHECKLIST**  
*(Mandatory before any `git push`)*  

1. **🕯️ Light the Candle of CI**  
   - Run `./sacrifice.sh --offer=coffee`  
   - If script fails, yell "I ACCEPT THE RISK" into your mic  

2. **🔮 Consult the Ops Oracle**  
   - Check #war-room for:  
     - [ ] No active fires *(or at least no new ones)*  
     - [ ] At least one SRE online *(or drunk enough to respond)*  

3. **🐔 Sacrifice a Rubber Chicken**  
   - Throw `:deploy-chicken:` emoji in Slack  
   - Wait for 3+ `:pray:` reactions  
   - *Alternative:* Bribe DevOps with taco receipts

## **💀 MIDNIGHT DEPLOY CEREMONY**  
*(For maximum chaos potential)*  

### **STEP 1: Summon the Council**  
```bash
curl -X POST https://slack.com/api/chat.postMessage \
  -d "channel=#panic-channel" \
  -d "text=@here DEPLOY O'CLOCK :skull-crossbones:" \
  -d "as_user=false" \
  -d "username=prod-gremlin"
```

### **STEP 2: Chant the Incantation**  
```python
# deploy_spell.py
def cast():
    print("By the power of caffeine and hubris,")
    print("I invoke the ancient rite of `git push --force`")
    print("May the CI gods have mercy on my soul.")
```

### **STEP 3: Spin the Wheel of Fate**  
```javascript
// wheel_of_devops.js
const outcomes = [
  "Works flawlessly (lol)",
  "Breaks auth for 40k users",
  "Silently corrupts DB",
  "Accidentally mines crypto"
];
console.log(outcomes[Math.floor(Math.random() * 4)]);
```
